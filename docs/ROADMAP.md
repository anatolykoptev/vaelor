## Phase 2: Structure — Enhanced Parsing & Cleaning

**Goal**: Improve code understanding quality. Additional languages, smarter cleaning modes, caching.

### 2.1 Additional languages ✅

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-28). 6 new languages added, 12 parser tests passing.

- [x] Rust handler (`handler_rust.go` + `rust.scm`) — functions, methods, structs, enums, traits, type aliases, consts, statics

**Total supported languages**: Go, Python, TypeScript/JS, Rust, Java, C, C++, Ruby, C# (9 languages).

### 2.2 Advanced cleaning modes ✅

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-28). New `internal/render` package, `mode` parameter on `repo_analyze`.

- [x] Signatures-only mode: extract API surface without bodies
- [x] Skeleton mode: structure with `// ...` placeholders
- [x] Focused mode: full bodies for query-relevant symbols, signatures for rest
- [x] Structural kinds (struct/interface/class/type) always preserve full body
- [x] Exposed as `mode` parameter on `repo_analyze` MCP tool

### 2.3 Multi-level analysis ✅

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-28). `depth` parameter on `repo_analyze`, three analysis levels.

- [x] Level 1 (overview): file tree + symbol signatures only (50K budget, signatures render mode)
- [x] Level 2 (module): selected files + dependency graph in Mermaid (150K budget, skeleton render mode)
- [x] Level 3 (deep): full function bodies for relevant symbols (200K budget, focused render mode)
- [x] Depth-aware system prompts (`SystemPromptForDepth`)
- [x] Default render mode inferred from depth (explicit `mode` overrides)
- [x] Dependency graph section injected between symbol summary and file contents

### 2.3a Noise reduction & quality fixes ✅

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-28). Released as v0.2.0.

- [x] `testdata/` added to default ignore dirs (all tools benefit)
- [x] `ExcludeTests` option — `symbol_search` and `dep_graph` skip `_test.go` files; `repo_analyze` keeps them for full picture
- [x] `symbol_search` result limit (default 100, max 500) — prevents unbounded output
- [x] `dep_graph`: stdlib imports filtered by default (`IncludeStdlib` opt-in)
- [x] `dep_graph`: self-import edges removed (test files importing own package)
- [x] `dep_graph`: format validation — unknown format returns error instead of silent fallback
- [x] Go parser: skip function-local var/const declarations (only package-level symbols)
- [x] Go parser: const block signature shows individual spec, not `const (`

### 2.4 Caching & performance ✅

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-28). New `internal/cache` package with LRU caches.

- [x] LLM response cache by FNV-1a hash of (systemPrompt + userPrompt), TTL 1h, LRU eviction (500 entries)
- [x] Parsed AST cache by (filePath, modTime, size) key, LRU eviction (5000 entries)
- [x] Configurable via env: `PARSE_CACHE_SIZE`, `LLM_CACHE_SIZE`, `LLM_CACHE_TTL_MIN`
- [x] 14 unit tests: get/set, TTL expiry, LRU eviction, staleness, concurrent access
- [ ] Git change frequency for file relevance ranking (deferred — using symbol count proxy)

**Deliverable**: Better analysis quality, more languages, faster repeated queries. ✅ Phase 2 complete.

---

## Phase 3: Comparison Engine ✅

**Goal**: Compare implementations between repositories to find the better solution.

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-28). `code_compare` tool fully operational.

### 3.1 Structural diff ✅
- [x] Symbol-level matching: exact (name+kind), fuzzy (Levenshtein, threshold 0.7), semantic (LLM classifier)
- [x] Side-by-side alignment of matched symbols with match score
- [x] Coverage gap detection (symbols missing from one side)
- [x] Metrics: avg/max function lines, test ratio, doc ratio, error handling ratio, interfaces, external deps (9 signals)

### 3.2 `code_compare` tool ✅
- [x] Input: 2 repos (GitHub or local) + query + optional focus/language filter
- [x] Parallel snapshot building (goroutine worker pool)

- [x] LLM analysis: quality verdicts, coverage gaps, architecture insights, recommendations
- [x] JSON output structured for AI consumption (CompareResult)
- [x] Budget-aware LLM context assembly (180K chars, 3K per snippet, 80 matched pairs, 40 gaps)

### 3.3 Module-level comparison ✅
- [x] Focus parameter for subdirectory-level comparison
- [x] Language filter for cross-language comparison
- [x] Quality-focused LLM prompt: finds better solution, not just differences

**Deliverable**: `code_compare` tool that compares two implementations and finds the better one. ✅

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Analysis

**Goal**: Deeper understanding of code.

### 4.1 Call chain tracing ✅

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-27). `call_trace` MCP tool operational.

- [x] Call extraction via tree-sitter queries for all 9 languages (separate `*_calls.scm` files)
- [x] Name-based resolution: same-file → same-package → cross-package
- [x] BFS trace with configurable depth (default 5, max 10)
- [x] Bidirectional: callees (forward) and callers (reverse)

- [x] LLM narrative explanation of execution flow
- [x] `call_trace` MCP tool with JSON output

### 4.2 Code graph ✅

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-28). `code_graph` MCP tool operational with Apache AGE.

- [x] Store symbols + relationships in Apache AGE (separate `gocode` database)
- [x] Schema: Package/File/Symbol vertices + CONTAINS/CALLS edges
- [x] 10 Cypher query templates (who_calls, calls_of, imports_of, symbols_in, etc.)
- [x] NL → Cypher hybrid: template classification + freeform LLM generation fallback
- [x] Lazy indexing with TTL cache (1h local, 24h remote)
- [x] Read-only guard on freeform Cypher (blocks writes)
- [x] `code_graph` MCP tool with JSON + LLM narrative output

### 4.3 Cross-language analysis ✅

**Ref**: [MLSA (arxiv 1808.01213)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01213) — monolingual graphs stitched at FFI boundaries; [rustic-ai/codeprism](https://github.com/rustic-ai/codeprism) — `EdgeKind::RoutesTo` for HTTP API boundaries.

**Deliverable**: Deep analysis capabilities — call chain tracing, code graph, cross-language API boundary linking. ✅

---

## Phase 5: go-search Migration ✅

**Goal**: Remove code tools from go-search, point to go-code.

**Status**: Complete (2026-02-28). All code tools migrated to go-code, removed from go-search.

### 5.1 New infrastructure ✅
- [x] `internal/retry` — generic exponential backoff with jitter
- [x] `internal/metrics` — atomic operation counters
- [x] `internal/cache` — GenericCache[T] with Redis L2 (go-redis/v9)
- [x] `internal/llm` — retry + fallback API keys + CompleteRaw
- [x] `internal/github` — SearchCode, SearchIssues, SearchRepos, ExtractOwnerRepo

- [x] Update go-search CLAUDE.md, tool count, metrics
- [x] Deploy both services, verify health

**Deliverable**: Clean separation. go-search = web search. go-code = code intelligence. ✅

---

## Phase 6: Graph Enrichment

**Goal**: Richer graph schema + faster re-indexing. Quick wins from competitive research.

### 6.1 Schema injection in freeform Cypher
- [ ] Inject full graph schema (vertex labels, edge types, properties) into `SystemPromptGenerateCypher`
- [ ] Currently freeform Cypher generation has no schema context → hallucinated property names
- [ ] Test on 5+ NL queries that previously failed

**Ref**: [code-graph-rag](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag) — schema text injected into LLM prompt for Cypher grounding.

### 6.2 IMPORTS edges
- [ ] Extract import paths from existing tree-sitter parsed data (already in `@import.path` captures)
- [ ] Add `IMPORTS` edge type: File → Package (or File → File for relative imports)
- [ ] Add Cypher template: `imports_of` (what does file X import?), `imported_by` (who imports package Y?)
- [ ] Update graph schema documentation

**Ref**: [CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext), [code-graph-rag](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag) — both store IMPORTS as first-class edges.

### 6.3 INHERITS / IMPLEMENTS edges
- [ ] New tree-sitter query captures: `@extends.base`, `@implements.interface` per language
- [ ] Go: interface satisfaction (type assertion patterns), struct embedding
- [ ] Python: `class Foo(Bar)`, Java/C#: `extends`/`implements`, TypeScript: `extends`/`implements`
- [ ] Rust: `impl Trait for Type`
- [ ] Add `INHERITS` and `IMPLEMENTS` edge types to `buildGraph()`
- [ ] Cypher templates: `hierarchy` (inheritance tree), `implementors` (who implements interface X?)

**Ref**: [rustic-ai/codeprism](https://github.com/rustic-ai/codeprism) — `EdgeKind::Extends`/`Implements`, strongly typed enums.

### 6.4 Incremental graph indexing
- [ ] Store FNV-64a hash per file in `code_graph_files` table (path, hash, indexed_at)
- [ ] On re-index: hash all files → diff against stored → parse only added/modified
- [ ] `DETACH DELETE` for removed files (cascade edges)
- [ ] Symbol-level diff for modified files (delete old symbols, insert new — not full file reindex)
- [ ] Persist hash state per graph, bump graph version to force rebuild on schema changes

**Ref**: [code-graph-rag](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag) — `FileHashCache` per file, JSON state; [CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext) — file watcher + per-file reindex.

**Deliverable**: Richer graph queries (imports, inheritance), 10-100x faster re-indexing for local repos.

---

## Phase 7: AST Structural Diff

**Goal**: True AST-level diff in `code_compare` using GumTree algorithm.

### 7.1 Integrate smacker/gum
- [ ] `go get github.com/smacker/gum` — same author as `smacker/go-tree-sitter`
- [ ] Use `gum/tsitter` adapter to convert tree-sitter CST → `gum.Tree`
- [ ] Verify tree-sitter version pin compatibility (same CGO dependency)

### 7.2 AST diff in code_compare
- [ ] `internal/compare/ast_diff.go` — function-level AST diff using `gum.Match()` + `gum.Patch()`
- [ ] Edit script output: Insert, Delete, Update, **Move** operations
- [ ] Move detection: function moved from file A to file B (not deleted+added)
- [ ] Integrate into existing `code_compare` output alongside symbol-level analysis
- [ ] LLM narrative enhanced with edit script data ("function X was moved", "function Y body changed")

### 7.3 Diff visualization
- [ ] Structured JSON output with edit operations
- [ ] Summary statistics: N moves, N updates, N deletes, N inserts
- [ ] Similarity score per matched function pair based on edit distance

**Ref**: [smacker/gum](https://github.com/smacker/gum) — Go GumTree implementation with tree-sitter adapter; [GumTreeDiff/gumtree](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree) — academic reference (ICSE 2014); [Wilfred/difftastic](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic) — hash-before-compare optimization.

**Deliverable**: `code_compare` produces structural edit scripts with move detection, not just "similar symbols".

---

## Phase 8: Code Health & Impact Analysis

**Goal**: New tools for assessing code quality and change risk.

### 8.1 Complexity metrics
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity via tree-sitter (count decision nodes: if/for/while/switch/case/&&/||)
- [ ] Cognitive complexity (nesting depth penalty)
- [ ] Per-function and per-file aggregation
- [ ] Expose as optional section in `repo_analyze` and `file_parse` output
- [ ] Hotspot detection: high complexity + high change frequency = hotspot

**Ref**: [ast-metrics](https://github.com/halleck45/ast-metrics) — Go, tree-sitter metrics with HTML dashboards; [CodeMCP](https://github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP) — `getFileComplexity`, `getHotspots`.

### 8.2 Impact analysis / blast radius
- [ ] New MCP tool: `impact_analysis` or extend `call_trace` with `mode=impact`
- [ ] Input: symbol name + repo → output: direct/indirect/transitive dependents
- [ ] Depth-scored: direct callers (high risk), transitive callers (medium), downstream (low)
- [ ] Uses existing CALLS edges from `code_graph` + call graph from `call_trace`
- [ ] LLM narrative: "changing this function affects N direct callers and M transitive dependents"

**Ref**: [Axon](https://github.com/harshkedia177/axon) — blast radius with confidence scores; [CodeMCP](https://github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP) — `analyzeImpact`, `analyzeChange`.

### 8.3 Dead code detection
- [ ] Multi-pass approach: (1) build call graph, (2) identify entry points, (3) mark unreachable
- [ ] Entry point heuristics: main(), init(), exported functions, HTTP handlers, test functions
- [ ] Framework awareness: don't flag handler functions registered via reflect/decorators
- [ ] Output: list of candidate dead symbols with confidence level
- [ ] Expose as new MCP tool or mode on `symbol_search`

**Ref**: [Axon](https://github.com/harshkedia177/axon) — multi-pass with framework awareness; [CodeGraphContext](https://github.com/CodeGraphContext/CodeGraphContext) — dead code via graph analysis.

**Deliverable**: Complexity metrics, blast radius tool, dead code candidates.

---

## Phase 9: Semantic Code Search

**Goal**: Find code by meaning, not just name patterns.

### 9.1 Embedding infrastructure
- [ ] Embed function bodies during graph indexing via memdb-go `/v1/embeddings` (1024-dim)
- [ ] Store embeddings in pgvector column on Symbol vertices (or companion table)
- [ ] Batch embedding: group functions into batches of 32, parallel requests
- [ ] Cache embeddings per (file_hash, symbol_name) — skip unchanged functions

**Ref**: [code-graph-rag](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag) — UniXcoder embeddings + vector DB; [Octocode](https://github.com/Muvon/octocode) — GraphRAG + semantic search.

### 9.2 Semantic search tool
- [ ] New MCP tool: `semantic_search` — NL query → embed → cosine similarity → top-K results
- [ ] Input: query text + repo + optional language/file filter
- [ ] Output: ranked list of functions with similarity score + source snippet
- [ ] Hybrid mode: combine embedding similarity with name-pattern matching

### 9.3 Graph-enhanced search
- [ ] After finding semantically similar functions, expand via graph edges
- [ ] "Functions similar to X" + "functions that call similar functions" (graph walk)
- [ ] Re-rank by graph centrality (PageRank or degree)

**Ref**: [CodeCompass (arxiv 2602.20048)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20048) — graph-based navigation achieves 99.4% task completion vs 76.2% baseline; agents need explicit prompting to use graph tools.

**Deliverable**: NL-powered code search that understands semantics beyond name matching.

---

## Phase 10: Type-Aware Analysis

**Goal**: Precision enhancement for Go repos via compiler-level intelligence.

### 10.1 SCIP backend for Go
- [ ] Optional `scip-go` integration for Go repos
- [ ] Parse SCIP index → extract precise CALLS/IMPLEMENTS/REFERENCES edges
- [ ] Merge SCIP data with tree-sitter data (SCIP primary, tree-sitter fallback)
- [ ] Stable symbol IDs from SCIP (survive renames)

**Ref**: [sourcegraph/scip](https://github.com/sourcegraph/scip) — Protobuf schema, Go bindings, streaming parser; [CodeMCP](https://github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP) — SCIP as primary backend with tree-sitter fallback; [williamfzc/srctx](https://github.com/williamfzc/srctx) — Go tool combining SCIP + tree-sitter.

### 10.2 Go-native call graph enhancement
- [ ] Optional `golang.org/x/tools/go/callgraph/rta` for Go repos
- [ ] Produces type-aware, compiler-accurate call resolution
- [ ] Merge with tree-sitter call graph (RTA for Go files, tree-sitter for others)
- [ ] Resolves interface dispatch, method sets, embedded types

### 10.3 Compound tools
- [ ] `explore` — combines `file_parse` + `symbol_search` + `dep_graph` for area overview
- [ ] `understand` — combines `call_trace` + `code_graph` + complexity for symbol deep-dive
- [ ] `prepare_change` — combines `impact_analysis` + `dead_code` for pre-change assessment
- [ ] Progressive tool disclosure: start with 8 core tools, reveal advanced on request

**Ref**: [CodeMCP](https://github.com/SimplyLiz/CodeMCP) — `explore`, `understand`, `prepareChange`, `expandToolset`; [CodeCompass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20048) — agents don't use tools they don't understand, compound tools improve discoverability.

**Deliverable**: Compiler-accurate analysis for Go, compound tools for reduced round-trips.

## Technical Debt Watch

- [ ] tree-sitter grammar version pinning (test after upgrades)
- [ ] CGO cross-compilation for ARM64 Docker builds
- [ ] Memory usage profiling for large repos (10K+ files)
- [x] Cache eviction strategy for long-running server (LRU + TTL in internal/cache)
- [ ] Rate limiting for GitHub API calls
- [x] MCP SDK v1.4.0 output schema compatibility (fixed: Out type must be `any`, not struct — otherwise `structuredContent: {}` overrides `content`)
- [x] jsonschema tag format (fixed: jsonschema_description instead of jsonschema:"description=")
- [x] Consistent versioning scheme (re-tagged: v1.0.0 → v1.4.0 in correct order)
