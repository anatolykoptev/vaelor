			"SAFETY: deletes embeddings-keys-not-in-state only; never deletes code_repo_state rows. " +
			"The intra-key orphan reconciliation that runs automatically in indexRepo handles per-symbol cleanup; " +
			"this tool handles entire-repo_key cleanup. " +
			"DRY-RUN BY DEFAULT: when dry_run is omitted (or true) the tool COUNTS the orphan repo_keys and the " +
			"rows that would be deleted WITHOUT mutating anything — pass dry_run=false to perform the real delete. " +
			"Idempotent: re-running when clean returns 0 deleted. " +
